#List of inventory slots to be handled by the plugin
#To get desired slotId run plugin with DEBUG enabled and interact with desired slots
#Format is slotId;ItemMetaSubtype
#Eventually you can tell the plugin to apply some filters to defined slots
#If you define a line such as "9;RING", it means that players might put into slot with slotid 9 only itemstacks having nbt tag nt-rpg:item_subtype
#The filters have to be defined in the section "ItemMetaSubtypes"
#You will not need those filters if:
# - You have a forge mod, which is already doing some checks for items before its equiped
# - You have a vanilla server and you are not interested in this filter feature, or you wish not to have any additional slots
#
#If you install any forge mod later, then you have to reconfigure this section, slotids might shift, it depends on mod load order and some sponge magic
